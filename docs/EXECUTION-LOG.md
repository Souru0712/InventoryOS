## 2026-11-04 — Owner decisions recorded: PD-01, PD-02, PD-31, PD-42 (docs only)

**Implemented**
- `docs/product/PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md`: C-24 InventoryOS is the new name for StockPulse; C-25 build on
  this codebase (repo rename pending, by the owner); C-26 target 21 paying customers, $1,000 MRR gates
  new revenue products; C-27 build order engine → Standalone → Square; C-28 `docs/product/` is the
  permanent docs home (follows from C-25). PD-03 and PD-21 narrowed by C-25.
- Propagated to README, vision, pricing, spec, glossary, JuJu parity and SaaS docs.

**Verified**
- Script check: 0 broken links; all PD/DR/AC/A/C/E/WF/FR references defined.

**Files changed**
- `docs/product/*`, this log.

**Open issues**
- StockPulse branding remains in code (`pyproject.toml` name, templates, `app/config.py`, marketing
  pages) — rebrand is code work, not done here.
- P0 still open: PD-13 (R1 scope), PD-18 (tenant isolation), PD-21 (auth).

**Decisions made**
- None by the agent; C-28 recorded as a direct consequence of C-25.

**Next task**
- Owner: rename the repository; answer PD-13. Agent, on go-ahead: Phase 2 audit against `docs/product/`.

## 2026-11-04 — InventoryOS Phase 1 revised: pricing by POS situation, operating modes (docs only)

**Implemented**
- Revised `docs/product/` to the owner's revised Phase 1 brief: files renamed to the brief's names
  (no numeric prefixes); new `PRICING_AND_PACKAGING.md`; vision rewritten (8 segments, journeys,
  competitive positioning, outcomes); workflows rewritten (24 + 4 supporting, full fields); roles
  rewritten (8 roles, location scope); spec gained operating modes, Module 15 Standalone
  Operations, UX structure, roadmap boundaries, prioritization matrix; domain gained
  InventoryTransaction, SalesTransaction/SalesSource, Plan/Entitlement, Transfer, DR-29..36;
  decisions rewritten with rationale/alternatives (C-01..23, PD-01..42, A-01..14, contradictions).
- The $49 single plan is superseded by the pricing hypotheses (Complete $99/location, Standalone
  $99, InventoryOS POS $149–199 future, Multi-location ~$149–199+, Advanced ~$199–299+).

**Verified**
- Script check: 0 broken links/anchors; every referenced PD, DR, AC, A, C, E, WF and FR ID is defined.
- JuJu `git status` clean; this repository changed only under `docs/` (untracked).

**Files changed**
- `docs/product/*` (13 renamed/updated + `PRICING_AND_PACKAGING.md` added).

**Open issues**
- P0: PD-01, PD-02, PD-13, PD-18, PD-21, PD-31, PD-42.

**Decisions made**
- None by the agent beyond recommendations recorded in `PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2.

**Next task**
- Owner reviews Phase 1. Phase 2 (existing-project audit) only on the owner's go-ahead.

## 2026-11-04 — InventoryOS Phase 1: product blueprint (docs only)

**Implemented**
- `docs/product/README.md` + documents 01–12 defining InventoryOS (new SaaS, no codebase):
  vision, 14-module specification with release tags, workflows WF-01..13, domain model and
  integrity rules DR-01..28, roles/permissions, SaaS requirements, JuJu reference + capability
  matrix, integration requirements, NFRs + production readiness standard, decisions
  (C-01..19, PD-01..30, A-01..12), glossary, acceptance criteria (118 `AC-` IDs).
- No application code, schema, tests or existing documentation changed in either repository.

**Verified**
- Internal links/anchors and cross-referenced IDs (PD, DR, AC, A, WF) resolve: script check, 0 broken.
- JuJu repository `git status` clean; this repository only gained files under `docs/product/`.
- Not verified: anything requiring running either application (out of Phase 1 scope).

**Files changed**
- Added: `docs/product/README.md`, `docs/product/01-…` through `12-…`.

**Open issues**
- P0 owner decisions: PD-01 (InventoryOS vs StockPulse identity), PD-02 (foundation), PD-03
  (JuJu relationship), PD-13 (release plan), PD-18 (tenant isolation), PD-21 (auth).

**Decisions made**
- None by the agent beyond recommendations recorded in `docs/product/10-PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md` §2.

**Next task**
- Owner: answer P0 decisions. Then Phase 2 technical audit against `docs/product/`.

## 2026-11-04 — Master project audit (audit only)

**Implemented**
- Audit deliverables 1–17 and the founder decision list in `docs/audit/`.
- 8 audit probes in `docs/audit/probes/test_audit_probes.py` (outside `tests/`, not collected by
  the suite) that reproduce the critical findings.
- No application code, migrations, tests or configuration changed.

**Verified**
- Full suite, SQLite, with developer `.env`: 496 passed, 46 failed, 6 skipped.
- Full suite, SQLite, `APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`: 542 passed, 6 skipped.
- Full suite, PostgreSQL 16 in the compose network (empty `stockpulse_audit` DB): 548 passed.
- Probes: 8/8 pass on SQLite and on PostgreSQL 16.
- Not performed: dependency vulnerability scan (needs `pip-audit` install); any live call to
  Square, Stripe, SMTP or Anthropic; load testing of the async-route stall (C8).

**Files changed**
- Added: `docs/audit/00-INDEX.md` … `12-decisions.md`, `docs/audit/probes/test_audit_probes.py`,
  `docs/EXECUTION-LOG.md`.

**Open issues** (see `docs/audit/01-executive-audit.md#findings-register`)
- Critical: O1 no git remote; C2 same-day consumption loss; C4 swallowed Square writes; C6 no ledger.
- High: C3, C5, C7, C8, P1–P5, S1–S3, T1.

**Decisions made**
- None. D1–D13 await the founder (`docs/audit/12-decisions.md`).

**Next task**
- Founder: B01 — create a private GitHub repo and push.
- Agent, on approval: B02 — hermetic test configuration.
